# Proxmox VM Suspension and Resumption Scripts

This repository contains two scripts, `suspend-vms.sh` and `resume-vms.sh`, designed to manage the suspension and resumption of virtual machines (VMs) on a Proxmox server.

## Script Locations

- **Suspend Script**:  
  Full path: `/root/suspend-vms.sh`

- **Resume Script**:  
  Full path: `/root/resume-vms.sh`

## Service Locations

- **Suspend Service**:  
  Full path: `/etc/systemd/system/suspend-vms.service`

- **Resume Service**:  
  Full path: `/etc/systemd/system/resume-vms.service`

## Implementation

These scripts and services should be implemented directly on the Proxmox server. They have been tested on a single-node setup and are not guaranteed to work in a clustered environment.

### Important Note

If a device is passed through to a VM, running the suspend script will shut down that VM. Ensure that you are aware of any passthrough devices before executing the scripts.

## Enabling Services

To enable the services, follow these steps:

1. **Reload the systemd daemon** to recognize the new service files:

   ```bash
   sudo systemctl daemon-reload
   sudo systemctl enable suspend-vms.service
   sudo systemctl enable resume-vms.service
   ```
